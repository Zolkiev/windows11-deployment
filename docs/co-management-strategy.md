# Co-Management Strategy for Windows 11 Deployment

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for implementing co-management between Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Microsoft Intune for Windows 11 devices. Co-management provides a bridge as we transition from traditional on-premises management to modern cloud management.

## Benefits of Co-Management

- Leverages existing SCCM infrastructure and investments
- Enables gradual transition to cloud management
- Provides redundancy and flexibility in device management
- Combines the strengths of both management platforms
- Supports modern deployment scenarios like Windows Autopilot
- Enables conditional access and compliance policies

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Co-Management Prerequisites

- Configuration Manager version 2111 or later
- Azure AD Premium licenses
- Microsoft Intune licenses
- Hybrid Azure AD Join or Azure AD Join
- Cloud Management Gateway (CMG) setup
- Network connectivity and firewall configuration

### Phase 2: Enable Co-Management

- Configure Azure AD Connect
- Configure auto-enrollment for Intune MDM
- Set up the Cloud Management Gateway
- Configure client settings for co-management
- Install the Configuration Manager client on test devices
- Enable co-management in the Configuration Manager console

### Phase 3: Workload Transition

Systematically transition management workloads from Configuration Manager to Intune:

| Workload | Phase | Timeline | Notes |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Compliance Policies | 1 | [Date] | Move compliance assessment to Intune |
| Resource Access Policies | 1 | [Date] | VPN, Wi-Fi, certificate configurations |
| Device Configuration | 2 | [Date] | Group Policy replacement |
| Endpoint Protection | 2 | [Date] | Microsoft Defender management |
| Software Updates | 3 | [Date] | Windows Update for Business integration |
| Client Apps | 3 | [Date] | Modern app delivery |
| Office Click-to-Run Apps | 3 | [Date] | Office 365 apps management |
| Windows 11 Deployment | 4 | [Date] | Autopilot deployment model |

### Phase 4: Full Intune Management (Future State)

- Azure AD native join
- Windows Autopilot for all new deployments
- SCCM maintained for legacy systems only

## Windows Autopilot Integration

### Autopilot and Co-Management

Our test implementation of Windows Autopilot will be integrated with co-management:

1. Devices registered in Windows Autopilot
2. Autopilot provisions basic OS with security settings
3. Intune enrolls device and installs critical applications
4. SCCM client installed via Intune
5. SCCM handles specialized application deployment and imaging tasks

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Co-management dashboard in SCCM
- Intune compliance reporting
- Azure AD device health reporting
- Pilot group feedback collection

## Security Considerations

- Conditional Access policies
- Device compliance requirements
- Data protection during transition
- Role-based access control

## Technical Implementation Details

See the following resources for detailed implementation steps:

- [Autopilot Test Plan](../autopilot/test-plans/autopilot-test-plan.md)
- [SCCM Configuration](../configs/sccm/client-settings.md)
- [Intune Configuration](../configs/intune/enrollment-profiles.md)

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of devices successfully co-managed
- Time to deploy new devices
- Help desk ticket reduction
- User satisfaction scores
- Security compliance metrics

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues with co-management, the rollback plan includes:

1. Disable automatic enrollment policies
2. Move workloads back to Configuration Manager
3. Use traditional deployment mechanisms for critical systems

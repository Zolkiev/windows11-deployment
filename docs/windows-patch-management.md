# Windows 11 Patch Management Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for managing updates and patches for Windows 11 enterprise devices. Effective patch management is critical for maintaining security, stability, and functionality of the operating system.

## Patch Management Approaches

Our environment utilizes multiple approaches to Windows update management:

### Windows Update for Business (WUfB)

- Primary method for cloud-managed devices
- Provides ring-based deployment capabilities
- Integrates with Intune and Azure AD
- Supports Update Compliance monitoring
- Uses delivery optimization for bandwidth control

### Configuration Manager (SCCM)

- Used for on-premises managed devices
- Provides detailed control and reporting
- Integrates with Software Update Point
- Supports phased deployments and maintenance windows
- Enables bandwidth control through BranchCache/Peer Cache

### Windows Autopatch

- Considered for future implementation
- Fully-automated update management
- Microsoft-managed update deployment rings
- Automatic testing and validation
- Integrated rollback capabilities

## Update Rings

We implement a ring-based deployment strategy to validate updates before wider deployment:

| Ring | Devices | Deferral | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| Preview | IT Test Lab (2%) | 0 days | Early testing and validation |
| Pilot | IT Staff (8%) | 5 days | Validation in production environment |
| Standard | General Staff (70%) | 14 days | Normal business operations |
| Critical | Executive/Specialized (20%) | 30 days | Business-critical systems |

## Update Types and Handling

### Quality Updates (Monthly)

- Security and reliability updates
- Deployed through WUfB or SCCM
- Automatic approval for Preview and Pilot rings
- Manual approval for Standard and Critical rings after testing

### Feature Updates (Annual)

- Major Windows functionality updates
- Extensively tested in lab environment
- Deployed first to Preview and Pilot rings
- Rolled out to Standard and Critical rings after 30-day validation
- Deployed using phased deployment

### Out-of-Band Updates

- Emergency security patches
- Accelerated testing and deployment based on risk assessment
- Emergency Change Advisory Board approval

## Update Compliance Monitoring

- Monitor update compliance through:
  - Intune reporting
  - Configuration Manager reporting
  - Windows Update for Business reports in Azure
  - Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center

## Update Delivery Optimization

- Implement peer-to-peer content sharing
- Configure content caching for remote locations
- Set bandwidth throttling during business hours
- Utilize delivery optimization analytics

## Maintenance Windows

- Regular maintenance windows established:
  - **Workstations**: Tuesday-Thursday, 6:00 PM - 11:00 PM
  - **Non-critical servers**: Saturday, 10:00 PM - 4:00 AM
  - **Critical servers**: Last Sunday of month, 12:00 AM - 4:00 AM

## Handling Update Failures

- Automated detection of update failures
- Standardized troubleshooting procedures
- Escalation path for persistent failures
- Restoration from backup when necessary

## User Experience Management

- Customized notifications for users
- Self-service update options during defined periods
- Education on update importance
- IT support processes during deployment periods

## Testing and Validation Procedures

- Pre-deployment testing in lab environment
- Application compatibility verification
- Driver compatibility verification
- Validation on representative hardware samples

## Documentation and Reporting

- Monthly patch compliance reports
- Quarterly review of patch management strategy
- Documentation of exceptions and deferrals
- Security vulnerability tracking

## Integration with Change Management

- Update deployment aligned with change management process
- Emergency update procedures documented
- Post-implementation reviews for major updates

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| IT Security | Security patch prioritization, vulnerability assessment |
| Desktop Team | Testing, deployment planning, exception handling |
| Server Team | Server update coordination, application owner communication |
| Help Desk | User support, issue triage, communication |
| Change Advisory Board | Approval of update schedules, emergency updates |

# Deployment Wave Planning

This document outlines the phased approach for deploying Windows 11 across the organization.

## Wave Structure

| Wave | Description | Timeline | Target Size | Focus |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Wave 0** | Technical Preparation | Weeks 1-4 | N/A | Infrastructure preparation, image testing, process development |
| **Wave 1** | Pilot Deployment | Weeks 5-8 | 30-50 devices | IT staff, power users, early adopters |
| **Wave 2** | Initial Department Rollout | Weeks 9-12 | 100-150 devices | Non-critical business units with standard application profiles |
| **Wave 3** | Main Deployment - Group A | Weeks 13-16 | 200-300 devices | General office staff with standard application needs |
| **Wave 4** | Main Deployment - Group B | Weeks 17-20 | 200-300 devices | Remaining standard office staff |
| **Wave 5** | Specialized Departments | Weeks 21-24 | 100-150 devices | Departments with specialized application needs |
| **Wave 6** | Final Deployment | Weeks 25-28 | Remaining devices | Cleanup, special cases, remote workers |

## Wave Criteria and Selection Process

### Decision Factors for Wave Assignment

1. **Business Criticality**:
   - Lower business-critical functions deploy earlier
   - Mission-critical operations deploy later for stability

2. **Application Complexity**:
   - Simple application profiles deploy first
   - Complex or specialized application profiles deploy later

3. **User Technical Proficiency**:
   - Higher technical proficiency users deploy earlier
   - Lower technical proficiency users deploy later

4. **Hardware Readiness**:
   - Newer hardware deploys earlier
   - Older hardware requiring evaluation deploys later

5. **Department Interdependencies**:
   - Departments with fewer interdependencies deploy earlier
   - Highly integrated departments deploy together

### Wave Assignment Process

1. Complete hardware and application inventory
2. Score departments based on the criteria above
3. Develop initial wave assignments
4. Review with department heads
5. Finalize and publish wave schedule

## Detailed Wave Planning

### Wave 1: Pilot Deployment

**Departments**: IT Department, selected power users from various departments
**Timeline**: Weeks 5-8
**Objectives**:
- Validate deployment process
- Identify and resolve technical issues
- Document common support scenarios
- Develop user training materials based on actual experiences

**Success Criteria**:
- 95% successful deployment rate
- All critical applications functioning
- User feedback indicates acceptable experience
- Support processes validated

### Wave 2: Initial Department Rollout

**Departments**: [Department A], [Department B], [Department C]
**Timeline**: Weeks 9-12
**Objectives**:
- Expand deployment to standard business users
- Validate scalability of deployment process
- Test department-specific applications
- Refine communication and scheduling processes

**Success Criteria**:
- 97% successful deployment rate
- Deployment schedule adherence
- Support tickets resolved within SLA
- Department-specific applications functioning correctly

### Wave 3-6: Remaining Deployment

*Detailed planning for these waves will be developed after the completion of Wave 2, incorporating lessons learned.*

## Wave Adjustment Process

The wave schedule may be adjusted based on:

1. Issues discovered during earlier waves
2. Business calendar changes or priorities
3. Hardware delivery timelines
4. Application compatibility discoveries
5. Resource availability

Any schedule changes will be communicated with a minimum 2-week notice to affected departments.
